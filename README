A set of scripts, to make easy of building FreeBSD VM images.

How to use it:

    1. Install bash, subversion, VirtualBox (VB for converting images; will be optional in future)
    2. Get this sources
    3. Run manually or by cron cd scripts && ./cron-auto-action.sh $V
    4. $V can be 8, 9  as FreeBSD Stable Version.
    5. Enjoy falling lines of compiling etc;
    6. Go to builds/$V and enjoy built images there (.img .vdi .vdi.zip .vdi.xz)
    7. Write some issue/bug report/feature request/enhancement proposal

Advanced usage:
    1. Create any dir, for example cs scripts && cd ../sources && mkdir MYTEST && svn co ANY_TAG_OR_BRANCH
    2. Run manually or by cron cd scripts && ./cron-auto-action.sh MYTEST 17 (17 is the number for MD device, it's must be a number :) )
    3. Run manually or by cron cd scripts && ./cron-auto-action.sh MYTEST 17 KDE48 (17 is the number for MD device, it's must be a number :) , KDE48 is a name of "mod")

Need to be done:
    Specifying ARCH other than i386 (currently hardcoded) for building;
    More fine-tune configuration of Image size, etc;
    Create image for testing KDE 4.8 Beta
    Create image for testing BHyVe
    Create image for testing laptops (You came into market with flash, boot laptop, run tests, dmesg etc, store all device's info, logs, etc - and send them to analyse)

Bugs:
    Switched from gpart to MBR, due to possible bug PR#161677

Update:
    2011-11-25
	9.0 no more support KMS (If I'm not mistaken) because of changes in sys/vm/device_pager.c, kib@'s patch no more applied.
	Probably, this file can be copied from 10, but I'm not sure.
	
	So, I added files which required to build KMS, but not sure if it's currently in need. Will use them for build 10.0-image though.
	Also, I made easier to create custom scripts. For example, if you want to build image for some project, like kde48b for 9, you should 
	provide such files: config/build-distrib-9-kde48b.sh and config/post-install-9-kde48b.sh. You can take files dedicated to KMS as an example.
	
	P.S. Anyone willing to help creating some image? :)
