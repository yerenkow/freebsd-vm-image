A set of scripts, to make easy of building FreeBSD VM images.

How to use it:

    1. Install bash, subversion, VirtualBox (for converting images; will be optional in future)
    2. Get this sources
    3. Run manually or by cron cd scripts && ./cron-auto-action.sh $V
    4. $V can be 8, 9  as FreeBSD Stable Version.
    5. Enjoy falling lines of compiling etc;
    6. Go to builds/$V and enjoy built images there (.img .vdi .vdi.zip .vdi.xz)
    7. Write some issue/bug report/feature request/enhancement proposal

Advanced usage:
    1. Create any dir, for example cs scripts && cd ../sources && mkdir MYTEST && svn co ANY_TAG_OR_BRANCH
    2. Run manually or by cron cd scripts && ./cron-auto-action.sh MYTEST 17 (17 is the number for MD device, it's must be a number :) )

Need to be done:
    Specifying ARCH for building;
    Adding a packet-list to install it
    More fine-tune configuration of Image size, etc;

Bugs:
    Somehow gpart slicing is broken now, need more investigation here :)
